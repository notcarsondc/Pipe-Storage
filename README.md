## Introduction OF Node

Pipe Firestarter Storage Node
Overview

A Pipe Firestarter Storage Node is a decentralized engine for storing and delivering data across the Firestarter network. Unlike centralized cloud services (Google Drive, Cloudflare, AWS), these nodes are operated by independent participants. Each node adds capacity, speed, and redundancy to the system, making Firestarter faster, safer, and resistant to censorship.

# Key Characteristics

## Distributed Data Layer

- Splits files into encrypted chunks stored across many nodes.

- Eliminates single points of failure or control.

## High-Speed Content Delivery

- Functions like a decentralized CDN, reducing latency for users globally.

- Supports real-time file access, streaming, and app integrations.

## Blockchain Integration

- Anchored to Solana for accountability, settlement, and coordination.

- Currently powers over 1 PB of historical Solana blockchain data, cutting validator sync times by ~30%.

## Economic Incentives

- Users pay with $PIPE tokens (1 PIPE â‰ˆ 1 GB).

- Tokens are burned for storage and re-minted as rewards to node operators.

- Creates a closed-loop, community-owned infrastructure.

## Notes
- first swap SOL to get PIPE, then upload files.
- Uploading more files increases your PIPE token rewards.
- Always keep a copy of your credentials and Solana public key for future use.
- This is an alpha so don't miss
